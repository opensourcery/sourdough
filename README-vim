There are a set of Vim files here that are the start of a useful collection of vim plugins for rails development.

The plugins that currently are included are:

 * rails.vim - http://rails.vim.tpope.net/
 * ack.vim - http://blog.ant0ine.com/2007/03/ack_and_vim_integration.html (haven't played with this enough to decide if it's useful)
 * bufexplorer.vim 
 * matchit.vim
 * gnupg.vim

bufexplorer, matchit, gnupg are all from the Gutsy Ubuntu vim-scripts package.

The are currently kept in:

.vim/doc
.vim/autoload
.vim/plugin

These can be copied into your ~/.vim/ directory.

We can easily add others and update to later versions for bufexplorer/matchit/gnupg.

There is also a .vimrc file that currently just provides shortcut keys for running tests in vim.
There are shortcuts for running the entire test file and also for running just the test case
that your cursor is currently sitting in.  Doing this for a basic Test::Unit test case is
simple.  Doing it for a Shoulda test case with nested contexts is more complex because the 
test method needs to be reconstructed from the various contexts.  This requires the
matchit.vim plugin to find the enclosing groups.
