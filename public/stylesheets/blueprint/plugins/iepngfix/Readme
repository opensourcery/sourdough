Usage
----------------------------------------------------------------

Remember that all divs and images that uses this plugin
must have both height and width specified.

1) Add this CSS rule to "blueprint/ie.css":  
   img, div { behavior: url(*YOURDOMAIN*/css/blueprint/plugins/iepngfix/iepngfix.htc) }

2) Customize the *YOURDOMAIN* and the rest of the URL in the CSS rule
   to be the http path to the iepngfix.htc file.

3) Customize line 15 in iepngfix.htc so that the URL is the 
   http path to blank.gif in this directory.

   
Known Issues
----------------------------------------------------------------

* Does NOT work with repeating background images
* Can't help IE versions prior to 5.5, sorry.
* Users can't right-click-save processed PNG images, they'll 
  save the blank GIF file if they try that. In some cases 
  this might be a feature, not a bug...
* The script detects the ".png" extension in image URLs. 
  So if you have a CGI script that generates a PNG image, you 
  may have to rewrite parts of the script, or just cache them 
  as PNG files somewhere.
* It's most reliable on elements with non-'auto' dimensions 
  set. So, give images and other elements width/height values; 
  '100%', '10em' and '200px' and so on are all OK.
* Background PNG images can't be tiled. This is a limitation 
  of the IE filter.
* Similarly, padding and borders don't indent the PNG image. 
  An easy fix for this is wrapping your PNG images in container 
  DIVs or similar.
* There may be about a short time as soon as the image loads 
  when images are not transparent, before the IE filter kicks in.
