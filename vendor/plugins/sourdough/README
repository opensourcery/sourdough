= Sourdough - An Application Starter in Ruby on Rails =

''' Sourdough is an application framework with the following features '''

 * Account Management
 * Picture Uploading
 * Time Zone Support
 * Administration
 * User Permissions
 * Internationalization
 * Clean CSS using Blueprint
 * Site spidering test harness
 * View debugging helper
 * Sample Capistrano deployment file

== Installation ==

 * export the sourdough project to a new directory that you will use as the base for your project
 * mv database.example to database.yml and edit it with your database information
 * mv email.example to email.yml and edit it with the name of the email account you want your server to be using
 * rake db:migrate
 * modify the language files in the lang/ directory to reflect the language of your application

== Upgrading ==

 * You should be pointing all plugins as an svn:external at the sourdough directory.
 * Performing an svn up will get you a new version of sourdough and all dependent plugins.
 * You then need to migrate the database
 * Rails engines has a mechanism to upgrade the schema.  If a new migration exists in sourdough/db/migrate you should be able to create a new migration in your project that is using sourdough and:

 {{{
    Rails.plugins["sourdough"].migrate(4)
 }}}

== Upgrading a plugin in the sourdough repository ==

 * We are using Piston to manage plugins within sourdough.  To upgrade a plugin you need to
   * sudo gem install piston
 * Go into the vendor directory and:
   * piston update name_of_plugin

== Release a new version of sourdough ==

 * To release a new version of sourdough create an svn tag in the format 2007-12-12a
 * Go to the project that is using sourdough and update all of your externals to point to this tag
 * svn up within your project directory and you should receive all of the new code

== Importing Fixture Data ==

 * rake db:fixtures:plugins:load PLUGIN=sourdough # This is broken because rails doesn't support foreign keys

== Running Tests on the Sourdough Framework ==

 * rake test:plugins PLUGIN=sourdough

== Changing Design ==

Suppose you want to overwrite a default view used in Sourdough such as the login screen.

 * Look in /vendor/plugins/sourdough/routes to figure out what file the login screen is
 * Discover that the login screen exists in /vendor/plugins/sourdough/app/views/session/new.rhtml
 * cp /vendor/plugins/sourdough/app/views/session/new.rhtml
 * Edit the file in the app directory as much as you want.

== Changing Controller or Model Behavior ==

Let's say we want to change the behavior of the user controller to add a method that implements OpenID

 * create a new file in app/controllers/users.rb

{{{
# Import the class from sourdough
require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../vendor/plugins/sourdough/app/controllers/users_controller')

# Add, or overwrite any methods you want
class UsersController < ApplicationController

  def open_id
    # Do some stuff here
  end

end
}}}

This is a test commit for svnmerge
